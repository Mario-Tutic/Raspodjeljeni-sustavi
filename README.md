To build a backend for an Uber-like service using FastAPI with a microservice architecture, you should break it into independent, loosely coupled services that communicate via APIs (REST) Hereâ€™s a suggested breakdown:

Core Microservices:

## User Service
Manages user registration, authentication, and profiles
Handles drivers and riders
Manages roles and permissions

## Ride Service
Handles ride requests, ride status updates
Matches drivers with riders
Manages ride pricing

## Driver Service
Manages driver profiles and availability(login)
Tracks location updates and ratings
Stores documents like licenses and vehicle registration

## Payment Service
Manages fares, invoices, and transactions
Integrates with third-party payment gateways
Handles refunds and promotions

## Notification Service
Sends SMS, emails, and push notifications
Manages ride confirmations and updates

## Geo-Location Service
Stores and updates real-time driver locations
Helps with nearest driver lookup
Uses mapping APIs for route optimization

## Review & Rating Service
Collects and stores ratings and reviews for riders and drivers
Uses analytics to provide insights

## Admin Panel Service
Provides an interface for administrators
Manages reports, disputes, and operational metrics

## Communication Between Services:
API Gateway: Acts as a single entry point for external requests
Service Discovery: Tools like Consul or Kubernetes for dynamic service lookup
Message Broker: RabbitMQ/Kafka for async communication (e.g., ride status updates)
Database: Each service should have its own database or use a shared DB with strict boundaries
